Is it from within?
Do we need it?
You must choose
If we keep it
When you decide,
Can you cheap it
Without a knife,
Can you weep it?

You've lost your life, one soul at a time
That's pretty damn tragic, don't you have it
Can you kick it, keep it from magic
I can't have it, neither can you

It is from within?
It's pretty ego, I'm a-
Why you try to cancel?
I'm kind of chancel, can't you see?
I'm new here, just living for free
