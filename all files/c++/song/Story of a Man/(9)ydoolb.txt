Is it from within?
Do we need it?
You must choose
If we keep it
When you decide,
Can you cheap it
Without a knife,
Can you weep it?

You've lost your life, one soul at a time
That's pretty damn tragic, don't you have it
Can you kick it, keep it from magic
I can't have it, neither can you

"He stated his views, leave it"
