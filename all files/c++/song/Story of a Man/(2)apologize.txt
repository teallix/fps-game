[intro]
I always find something wrong
You've been fucking with a bitch now way too long
You're so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to be disclosed
Whatever you do stays on earth
What is your worth, -

I never talk much to females, it's apparent, isn't it
Just sitting on these e-mails, I inherent, visit it
Transparent, I'll parent, the kid of the wife of Guerrant
It's pretty unapparent, I'm a little unromantic
Manic manic manic manic panic
Panic without freeze is satanic
I'm a little ill, little Germanic
Little pain, with a ocean away, I
Walk a little line, 'cause these days I've been losing my mind
Copy a little lie, fuck a little time
Live a little nice day, I relive it my way

I'm bleeding, bleeding, blood all on my feelings
Nose bleed, close keep
I need, to see me
I weep, on my knees
Why can't you just come see me
Doctor, I need your keys
Please just see me
[car crash]

"Oh fuck, I think I'm dead"
"Kind of cool honestly, wanted to be anyways"
"I wonder what it's like to have another mans' blood on your hands"
"You made me do this, now live with it"

Live with it bitch
I died for nothing
This happens everyday
You know something, just say it
I pray it, we fray it
Why say it?, we made it
Who ate it, you break it
In a bit, he'll say who did it
You a sickness, can't get rid of it

A bad nose bleed, I need your keys
I'll repeat this, why you need this?
The fall off will bend and my life will end
You want this, I know you do
Kind of dantless, be true to you
Why'd you do this?, I'm dead now
Why you foolin?, I read how
Children listen, loyalty lies
I dispise, a new revise
I'm a man who killed himself, rebuild himself
Fuck my world, I billed myself
Why you laugh at me, built calf of me
Respat at me, build graph of me
Now I'm dead, bitch give head
I've done read, get in bed?!

Fuck your world up, ems in mortars
I need worta, I'm in Florida
What it your core?, what a whore
I need more, I NEED MORE[MORE BITCH]
MY APOLIZATION IS QUITE INSATION
BUILD A STATION TO GO OUT GRACIOUS
