[chorus]
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm trying to protect you
You act as if you full of glee
I act as if this is new

I've been feelin' myself[yea]
Where is everyone else[yea]
Can't trust no one,[yea]
Can't even trust yo' self[yea]
Why is this the end?
I can't trust no friends

I love you, I ain't love nobody else
I'm sayin' "I" a lot why we don't talk about you else
Untrustworthy, I'm love worthy
I'm feelin' dirty, can't trust not worthy
You killin' thirty, no girl you purty
Untrustworthy

Won't write a story
I write, it's boring
Go exploring, new grand pouring
You ignoring, old man flooring
I don't got the song
Don't write no wrong
I'm feeling fine
Your feelings, mine

[chorus]
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm trying to protect you
You act as if you full of glee
I act as if this is new

I fill in-between
Full of lies to keep
Try to make it seem
Like I'm some sort of king
I'm untrustworthy, feel a bit earthy
Thinkin' 'bout hoppin' out tha' car
Run down the road to get hit
I'll catch another bitch
I'll get another lick
With that stain on the carpet,
Something's from Target
Got my blood at the market
From a knife, is the sharpest
5 days later, the truth comes from
Another phone search, a new order come
Where was my thumb, said it was bit numb
In her pussy, wet, says it was, not yet
In a bit, he'll forget
Another way to win

[chorus]
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm trying to protect you
You act as if you full of glee
I act as if this is new

I'm as real as everyone else
I'mma feel when you there
I'mma go catch a lick
You in a fit
I'm a bit lit, takin' a hit
Gettin' a bitch
You is a-[untrustworthy]
[I'm feelin' dirty]
[Come get it, hurry]

Neverless, I'm a mess
You missed, guest
I'm your best
You taking
