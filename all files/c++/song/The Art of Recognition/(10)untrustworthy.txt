[intro]
I'm numb in dispair
Can you please help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me

[chorus]
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm trying to protect you
You act as if you full of glee
I act as if this is new
I've been feelin' myself[yea]
Where is everyone else[yea]
Can't trust no one,[yea]
Can't even trust yo' self[yea]
Why is this the end?
I can't trust no friends

I love you, I ain't love nobody else
I'm sayin' "I" a lot why we don't talk about you else
Untrustworthy, I'm love worthy
I'm feelin' dirty, can't trust not worthy
You killin' thirty, no girl you purty
Untrustworthy

Won't write a story
I write, it's boring
Go exploring, new grand pouring
You ignoring, old man flooring
I don't got the song
Don't write no wrong
I'm feeling fine
Your feelings, mine

[chorus]
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm trying to protect you
You act as if you full of glee
I act as if this is new

I fill in-between
Full of lies to keep
Try to make it seem
Like I'm some sort of king
I'm untrustworthy, feel a bit earthy
Thinkin' 'bout hoppin' out tha' car
Run down the road to get hit
I'll catch another bitch
I'll get another lick
With that stain on the carpet,
Something's from Target
Got my blood at the market
From a knife, is the sharpest
5 days later, the truth comes from
Another phone search, a new order come
Where was my thumb, said it was bit numb
In her mind, was kept, says it was, not yet
In a bit, he'll forget
Another way to win

[chorus]
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm trying to protect you
You act as if you full of glee
I act as if this is new

I forgot who it is, forgot who it was
Keep asking me, I'll say it's a buzz
I'll say it's just because
Why you really, really wanna' say it's a bit of silly
In a pity party just to say it's nothing but Mccarty
I'm a little hearty, say I'm a little hardy
Untrustful

[chorus]
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm trying to protect you
Why you keep lying to me?
It's making me miss you[old]

And I forgot who, say it was not
But a little sense of glee to be on top
And I won't stop,
I say it's a bad drop
A drop in the market
A drop, we will park it
A flood, we will spark it
Some blood, we will hark "it!"

In my lies, I dispise
That who tries, tries to be wise
We suprise, that who will arise
With disguise, a new murder ties[fade out]
[Murder the king and you'll be rewarded]
[It won't be recorded, you won't be reported]

In the streets it's pouring, a blood river
In my sheets I be touring, a flood bigger
In the nights, I be curing,
A disease killing me, during,
A wake bigger, maturing

I don't trust you
I don't love you
I'm above you
Keep it up, you
I'mma jump you
Why you lie
Untrustworthy
I can't trust you

He was running
A friend of mine
He was husslin'
An old co-sign
A new worker
He was an old man, fine
I was lookin'
For a new red wine
It was an older one
From the 90s, man
Not the one 90s
More like olden times
Back when kings were kings
And countries went to war
Over one murder, when there wasn't anymore

Trust is earned, got to learn
How to yearn, for the burn
I find diamonds, I keep findin'
A new rhymin', for you, mindin'[yea]
Found a new world
Keep it burned down
What is that sound?
I need a pound
These are my lies, I need new eyes
I can't rewrite, the gemini

[chorus]
Why you keep lying to me?
I made new lies
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm ashamed of my eyes

I don't want to be punished
I just want you to love me
We can run it
I want you above me

I want what you have
I want, why you mad?
I lie, so my bad
I keep being glad

I'll ride for my homies
I ride, now you owe me
You won't be a phony
I can't now, so hold me

Won't harm me
That alarms me
I'm a charm, me
You a car meet

Can you love me?
Can you shove me
In an arm to hold above me
I'm a dove, me

I'm a akward person
Make it worsen
In the corner store of 3rd street
Out of the heat

We embarrassed
On my own chest
Need a new end
Repeat to lend

Privacy is a minus
Out of shyness
That's a sinus
Of old virus

Want control over you
Want to role over you
I'm above, over you
It's because, over you

[chorus]
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm trustworthy
Why you keep lying to me?
I'm untrustworthy
And I'm feeling dirty
Untrustworthy

I like making you cry
I like watching you die
It's fun for me
Not enough for me
You should run from me
We begun only, not enough
Untrustworthy
