[intro]
Lust, tell me if I'm wrong
Lust, I must now
I corrupt people
I'm a must people

[chorus]
Lust made me who I am
I've been removed by society
There's no variety
This isn't discussed
You disgust me
It's unjust, free

Why you disgust?[ing]
Fuck around and get a wrong[song]
Where you belong?
All these questions[prolong]

Hey, bae
Why you always wanna' say "hey"?
First hand account
How much is your ammount

What are we?
Can't you see
That these hoes I fucked at left a B

Why lie?
I'd never do that
Lie again
I'd never be back

Sex is best
Why confess
Lust lust, it's a must
Why you trying it up

Many people fall into it
Many people walk for a tit
It's a problem you know
One that I have
Take over my life
It's just a big hoe

I got a knife
Just to take my life
Not suicidal, another title
Fucking this vital
Bitch you're entitled
Can I remind ya'
I'm gonna' refind ya'
Trust[me]

[chorus]
Lust made me who I am
I've been removed by society
There's no variety
This isn't discussed
You disgust me
It's unjust, free[me]

[like]Most of you really don't know the story[yet]
Most of you really don't care that more[yea]
Maybe I'll try it at a quarry[yea]
When you do want to know[yea]
I'll tell you but it'll be out of glory[yea]
On track7 maybe I might do it right[yea]

I'm a sex slave, on my best day
It's a next way, not today
I'm a mess, don't protest
I'll confess, or in the next[yea]

It's the open, mighty show when?
'nother opus, I'd don't work, when
When I show, for you hoe
There's a door, not no more

[chorus]
Lust made me who I am
I've been removed by society
There's no variety
This isn't discussed
You disgust me
It's unjust, free[me]
