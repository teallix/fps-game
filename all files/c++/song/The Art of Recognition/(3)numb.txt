You won't even look at me
Why won't you just fuck with me
Trying to keep balance
Can't keep my balance

Just get off your headphone[dank]
Just fuck with your man now[drank]
Just get a hotel room[bank]
Just try to assume[rank][aye]
Say I'm obsessed
Keep me oppressed, keep me depressed
Don't wanna fuck, now bitch duck!

[beat switch, talk]
Wake up
WAKE UP!
It's time to go

Stay humble, blame others
Keep crumble, lose brothers
Why utter?, keep it up
Why strutter?, keep it tucked
Why fuck her?, keep up stuck
Why cut her?, keep it buck
Luck luck luck luck
Don't get struck, don't got luck

[chorus]
You want more, more more talk
You want gore, more more walk
This ain't personal, eternal
Do this all, for you all

A computer, loot her
Who's her?, I don't kner
Why speak right?
I don't fight
Why unite?
Let's keep it tight

Times get shorter, rhymes with mortar
Keep it together, get it wheathered
Take it down, keep it around
Go around town, don't make a sound

Kim changing things, guess Kanye wasn't enough
She a copycat, guess he was too tough
Architecture?, shake my head
Not a lecture, shake the bed[like]

Songs getting shorter, mine's getting more love
The leaving quarter, mine's get more gloves
Hypatia, vacatia
My patient, biracia'
Not her name, but a race
Not their fame, but a case
Case of existence, case of a distance
Don't really fuck it up but end this

[chorus]
You want more, more more talk
You want gore, more more walk
This ain't personal, eternal
Do this all, for you all

None of you care, I'm an underground
No one is fair, not for a run around
You an actor?, that's a factor
To your success, not to confess
You did it, you know it
You row it, just show it
