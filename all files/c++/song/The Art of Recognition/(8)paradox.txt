[intro]
Life's a paradox
I said life's a paradox
Don't you understand?
Nothing is true to a real man

Say real man?, don't kill man
Take a ganda', understand her?
I really wanna' just talk
I really wanna' just walk
Don't open up, don't show enough
Why open up?, don't care enough[you]

This is rough, not enough
Why you tough, you just bluff
Keep it up, keep it up
Not enough, not enough

Say one thing, mean another
Do one thing, was another
Keep it brother, keep it mother
Was another, not to utter

[chorus]
Life's a paradox
I said life's a paradox
Don't you understand?
Nothing it true to a real man
Real man, Real man
Real man, Real man
What's a real man?

Yeah, what's a real man?
A lier, a cheater, a beater?
Repeat her
Yeah, Yeah
That's right, that's right
Back that up, now back that up

Nothing said is right, or thought is right
Get it right[oh], get it right[oh]
Is he white?[no], is he black?[no]
Does he fight?[yes], does he lack?[yes]

Is it rated?[yes], does he make it?[yes]
When it's weighted keep it dangerous
Going brainless, going dumb[for sure]
Like I never wanted before
Where from?, where from?
Where from?, where from?
When we go 'round just say it
Don't outweigh it, don't resay it[aye]
Just remake it, then resay it[aye]

Missing numbas', missing lyrics
Missing runnas's, missing spirits
Not gon' find it, not gon' mind it
People like it, don't remind it

[chorus]
Life's a paradox
I said life's a paradox
Don't you understand?
Nothing it true to a real man
Real man, Real man
Real man, Real man
What's a real man?
