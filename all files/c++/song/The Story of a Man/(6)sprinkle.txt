[chorus]
Who was in the right?
He wanted to fight
It was in the night,
I'm running out of light

I had a friend, a really good friend
I would mend at only extend
He would defend his only partner
I would want to take it, smarter
She was queen for the teen
In beetween all the green, was a little make believe
They broke up over, a little bit naive
She was looking at another boy, her ex [you]may say
She was his little toy, years ago today[hey]
So he got mad, a little sad
Was depressed without a test
Wasn't glad, not for the freedom
A new best was for one, need 'em

He was a bit older, needed closure
They got back together, he was happy now
Got exposure, but he was happy how?
A little leave made him almost kill himself
When he really feels himself, he will almost deal himself
He won't believe, not what he sees
He won't recieve, not what his ease

Second time they broke, she talked to me
First time we spoke, why?, what'd she really see
Started getting freaky with me, she really sneaky with me
I didn't know how it really be, I told him and he's really free
Didn't get mad since I told him, went a little further
She blocked me and got mad, he told me he's really glad
First time I talked to, a real human, I'm real glad[deep]
2 weeks later the same strangers back together again, third time is it?
I don't know how it really be, just hit it
It doesn't really fit, 13 or 15, it won't sit

[chorus]
Who was in the right?
He wanted to fight
It was in the night,
I'm running out of light
when the light runs out,
Where do I go?
Can you not find out,
Where is another show
Who was in the right?
He wanted to fight
It was in the night,
I'm running out of light
when the light runs out,
Where do I go?
Can you not find out,
Where is another show

[outro]
Feel like I'm making a scene
A type show to be seen
He's fifteen,
Running for a teen
