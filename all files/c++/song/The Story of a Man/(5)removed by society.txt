Was a normal kid, 13
Running track a bit lately
Say he really dont need heat
Just gon run until hes been beat

When he met that girl
Without curls[yea]
It was over man, yea he gone
Matter fact he lost

He just wanna fuck
He don't wanna flirt
Oh your feelings hurt?
Oh no eat some dirt
You a little burt

You gave consent
Don't blame it on him
Just taking fent
Bitch fucking on him

Wait not fucking
He not really tucking
Bitch you said "fuck yea" [fuck yea]
What you trippin' on [fuck yea]
What you sippin' on [fuck yea]

Can't replace me
Can't go fake me
Can't go run around and jake me
wait not me
yea that not you
just bought a 2
catchin for you too

Now why you fakin, lyin
runnin 'round and find em
dont get a new text so you just
go and try spyin

he was a bit sexual
feelin textual
Can't get over feeling flexible
Now all these girl keep going 'round
And always be sensual
Homosexual like fentanyl

Accusin him
Confusing him
Abusing him
Just using him

Bitch gon' get some stiches
'Cause he dont need no bitches
He just wanna' fuck
Don't got to tuck
Has bit of luck
Got bitch to suck

Man she said yes
He asked his best
For no confess
When there's no test

No one's perfect
Now you hurting
Fucking flirting
Get some loving

Bitch thats me
Him is me
Gradually
From a tree
Let it be
[the]Fuck it be?

Now fight my eyes
Don't live this pain
Don't get no gain
From a lane
You feel the same?
Now fall away
Not playing this game

This my life
Yea' this my pain
I feel the same
Can't go away

Suicide
'Cause you threw aside
I dont abide
The feelings inside

Bitch move aside
You in my way
Bitch drew a side
Get out my face

These feeling, mine
These killings, mine
These dealing, mine
These fucked up over end fantasies, mine

I'm lost without you
This my life
Yea' this my life

I'm pessimistic
Full of sickness
Fighting weakness
Stop the killing- //gunshot
